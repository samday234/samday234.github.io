  <h1>MERMAID OF DEATH</h1>

<p> A little bit after my review, spring semester of my sophomore year, I went outside just to draw for pleasure. I didn’t have a particular goal in mind so I  just drew what I felt like drawing. I still find it funny how on a sunny spring day I managed to come up with a drawing I refer to as “The Mermaid of Death.” </p>
