  <h1>TIE OF TIES</h1>
<p><img src='images2/tiee.jpg' alt="photo1"/></p>


<p>Before I declared my major I took a sculpture class in my freshman year called form study. The goal for this piece was to create process artwork through repetition of simple actions. So I tied fabric and kept tyeing it until I eventually made a giant tie. This project helped to teach me patience in how lots of little actions could create something big. </p>
